The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:

n - n/2 (n is even)
n - 3n + 1 (n is odd)

Using this rule, and starting with n = 12, one gets the sequence:

12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

This sequence contains 10 terms.  Although not proved, it is considered that Collatz starting numbers will finish at 1.

Create a program to calculate the terms when n = 19.

Create a program to calculate the terms when n = 27.

Create a program that calculates which starting number, under 1,000,000 produces the longest chain.
