Consider the following Fibonacci numbers:

0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,â€¦

The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.

The 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1)
The 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2),
And the 5 is (2+3), etc.

If we consider Fibonacci number (F) 
F0 = 0 and F1= 1 then:

Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2

where:

Fn is term number "n"
Fn-1 is the previous term (n-1)
Fn-2 is the term before that (n-2)

Using C#, create a computer program that outputs the first 11 Fibonacci numbers from a function that does not use recursion. 

Then ...
